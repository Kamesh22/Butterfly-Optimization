# Butterfly-Optimization

In this project, we use Random forest as the classification model, and the fitness function is the accuracy of the model on the testing set. We start by splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, then define the fitness function and Butterfly Optimization function. We then run the Butterfly Optimization algorithm to find the best parameters and best fitness functionn which can imporve the R2 score and decrease the error rate.
