# Butterfly-Optimization

In this project, we use Logistic Regression as the classification model, and the fitness function is the accuracy of the model on the testing set. We start by splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, then define the fitness function and Butterfly Optimization function. We then run the Butterfly Optimization algorithm to select the best features, and print out the selected features and their corresponding column names.
